# Collection of DApps and Smart Contracts for Ethereum

![Screenshot](https://github.com/kozyilmaz/ethereum-dapps/raw/master/docs/wallet-tests.png "Ethereum DApp Development")

## Contents

This repository contains sample DApps and smart contracts developed for Ethereum platform. All smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum's **Rinkeby** testnet. [Metamask](https://metamask.io) browser extension is used for testing and development  
Some of the tests may require Metamask/Mist due to account accesses, however pages like `crc32.html` may be tested just using [Infura](https://infura.io).  
Please check out the `*.js` files in `app` directory. By setting `infuraAPIKey` variable you may execute most of the tests without needing Metamask/Mist  

* Ethereum network access via web3 provider may be checked using `app/conn.*` files
* CRC32 DApp in `app/crc32.*` interfaces with a [IEEE 802.3 compliant CRC32 calculator smart contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0f7363cbad2f8d9f63bb64aad5dabaf3f1ff1a0c#code)
* Wallet DApp in `app/wallet.*` interfaces with the [NoNameToken, a StandardBurnable ERC20 token smart contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0edd6c7576e31a740e7bef46388bf91057631b60#code)


## Setting Up

Please refer to the following step-by-step guides to setup and start development with Truffle  

* [How to setup Truffle for macOS and Linux](docs/README.00-truffle.md)
* [How to build Geth on macOS and Linux](docs/README.01-geth.md)


## Development and Testing

Basic commands for development and testing are as follows

```sh
# everytime you had a fresh checkout, get dependencies via
$ npm install

# compile smart contracts
$ truffle compile

# test smart contracts
$ truffle test

#Â create an .env file to store wallet seed and infura api keys in project root dir
$ cat .env
MNEMONIC=<wallet seed phrases (may be Metamask)>
INFURA_API_KEY=<infura api key>

# deploy smart contracts on various networks
$ truffle migrate --network localhost
$ truffle migrate --network mainnet
$ truffle migrate --network ropsten
$ truffle migrate --network rinkeby

# serve static content with lite-server at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```
